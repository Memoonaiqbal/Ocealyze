# Ocealyze: Machine Learning-Powered Oceanographic Data Mining Platform

**Ocealyze** is an interactive, web-based platform designed to democratize access to complex oceanographic datasets stored in NetCDF format. Built with Python and Streamlit, it empowers users—regardless of their programming background—to explore, visualize, and model environmental data using machine learning.

## 🚀 Features

* **📥 NetCDF File Ingestion**
  Load `.nc` files directly in-browser with automatic integrity checks and variable validation.

* **🧼 Data Preprocessing**
  Cleans missing entries using `_FillValue`, standardizes time formats, and extracts numerical arrays for analysis.

* **📊 Dynamic Visualizations**
  Visualize global distributions, depth profiles, time trends, and parameter histograms using interactive Plotly graphs.

* **🧠 Machine Learning Modules**

  * **Clustering:** K-Means for environmental grouping
  * **Classification:** Decision Tree-based water mass categorization
  * **Regression:** Random Forest prediction of temperature, salinity, or oxygen levels

* **📋 Metadata Summary**
  Auto-generated summaries of depth ranges, geographic coverage, and variable statistics.

* **📤 Report Export**
  Export analyzed data and visual insights to `.csv` for further academic or research use.

* **✨ Elegant UI**
  Clean glassmorphism design built with Streamlit’s customizable components.

## 🛠️ System Architecture

* **Frontend:** Streamlit + Plotly
* **Backend:** Python (`netCDF4`, `xarray`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `scikit-learn`)
* **Visualization:** Plotly Express & Graph Objects
* **Modeling:** K-Means, Decision Trees, Random Forests
* **Exports:** CSV summary reports

## 📦 Installation
# Clone the repository
git clone https://[github.com/memoona/Ocealyze.git](https://github.com/Memoonaiqbal/Ocealyze)

cd Oceanlyze

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the app
streamlit run app.py

## 📊 Example Use Cases

* Visualizing global temperature,oxygen and salinity distributions
* Identifying thermoclines from vertical profiles
* Classifying water masses (e.g., Tropical, Polar, Temperate)
* Predicting oxygen concentration based on geographic and depth features

## 🧪 Evaluation Highlights

* 📁 File load time: < 3 seconds (5000 entries)
* 📈 Visualization render time: \~2 seconds
* 🧠 ML model accuracy:
  * Classification: \~92%
  * Regression RMSE: 0.3–0.4

## 👩‍🔬 User Feedback

> From a study with 15 marine science students:
* 95% found Pcealyze intuitive
* 90% preferred it over Ocean Data View (ODV)
* 100% were able to complete analysis and export tasks without code

## 🔮 Roadmap

* ✅ v1.0: Local NetCDF ingestion and ML support
* ☁️ v2.0 (Planned):
  * NOAA API and ERDDAP server integration
  * LSTM/Prophet for time-series forecasting
  * Cloud data storage & multi-user collaboration
  * Auto-generated scientific report exports
